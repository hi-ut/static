          In 1984, the Historiographical Institute innovated historical
          information database system, and in 1997 made it available online. The
          system has become an indispensable source of scholarly information for
          those studying on the history of Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The International Center for the Digitization of Pre-modern Japanese
          Sources (CDPS), established in 2006, functions as a core unit for
          historical information research within the Institute. The Center has
          adopted achievements and methods from the field of informatics. From
          2009 onwards, the Center has also been providing support for
          activities relating to the Institute’s role as a joint base for
          scholars from all over Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the CDPS is to make use of computing and networking
          technology to build an effective structure for process of accessing
          historical materials, developing them as research resources, and
          ensuring their incorporation into the cultural fabric of society in
          the form of historical knowledge; to this end, the Center has three
          sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          a) Annotation and revision of existing databases; systematization,
          standardization and multilingual support for both data and systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) The digital photographing and the digitization of existing historic
          photographs (working from microfilm, and in some cases from glass
          plates)
        </p>
        <p>
          c) Transformation of historical document collections into knowledge
          that allows the fruits of historical research to be shared throughout
          academia and society.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head of the Center or the Institute’s Director supervises the
          staff. The CDPS committee is chaired by the Institute’s Chief
          Information Officer. The Information Support Group for the Institute’s
          staff is affiliated with the Center.

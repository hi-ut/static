          The Special Materials Department has two distinct sections. One
          focuses on source analysis (shiryogaku) and historical geography
          (rekishi chiri), while the other deals with historical documents kept
          outside of Japan or written in foreign languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          The former analyzes on Japanese monograms (kaō) and publishes
          collected monograms in the Kao Kagami.

        <p>
          The latter, or the Overseas Materials Section, publishes Jesuit
          Letters Concerning Japan (-1559, original texts mainly in Portuguese
          and Spanish) and Diaries Kept by the Heads of the Dutch Factory in
          Japan (-1651, original texts in Dutch) with Japanese translation.
          These and comparable European sources enable us to view Japan’s
          relationships with the rest of Asia in the late medieval- early modern
          periods. For more details, see
          <a

            >publications page</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Overseas Materials Section is also engaged in cataloguing
          microfilmed documents acquired from overseas. Since 1954, the
          Historiographical Institute has collected microfilms of unpublished
          documents concerning Japan kept in overseas libraries and archives.
          This project was entrusted to us by the Japan Academy, and subsidized
          by UAI (Union Academique Internationale) and UNESCO-CIPSH until 1985.
          Since 1985 the Historiographical Institute has continued to collect
          overseas documents with support from the Japanese government (KAKENHI
          by JSPS: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and MEXT:
          Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology) and
          other funding organizations. Recently, we have been engaged in the
          digitization of the microfilm collection as well as acquiring newly
          digitized materials.
